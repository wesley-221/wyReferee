		Welcome to wyReferee client. This client allows you to create, manage, publish and import both mappools and
		tournaments. It has a lot of QoL features for osu! multiplayer lobbies, such as picking maps from a mappool with
		just a single click on a button.

	<h1>Getting started</h1>
	<p>
		Head on over to <a [routerLink]="['settings']">Settings</a> where all the general settings are located.
	</p>

	<h2>osu! authentication</h2>
	<p>
		This is used to identify who you are. A new window will pop up where you will have to give permission for wyReferee
		to read public data on your behalf. This basically means that wyReferee will be able to tell who is logged in, which
		then will be used to give you permissions to create, edit and view tournaments.
	</p>

	<h2>osu! irc</h2>
	<p>
		Probably the single most important feature of this client. The irc connection is used to create multiplayer lobbies,
		as well as communicate in those multiplayer lobbies. Get your irc credentials by clicking on the link just below the
		Connect button.
	</p>

	<h2>osu!api key</h2>
	<p>
		This client requires you to set your api key to get various data from the osu server. In order for the client to
		show everything properly, we have to get data from the osu! servers. This way we will be able to get all multiplayer
		match data and beatmap data.
	</p>

	<h2>Making your own tournament</h2>
	<p>
		<b>NEW: Publishing your tournaments is now publicly available.</b> <br />
